📌 Project Overview

This project evolved from a basic script into a structured application. It serves as a playground for implementing backend best practices, including:

    Separation of Concerns: Business logic is decoupled from the User Interface (CLI).

    Evolutionary Design: Refactored from procedural functions to a robust OOP structure.

    Data Integrity: Validates user input before processing business logic.

🏗️ Architectural Evolution

This repository reflects a three-stage development process:

    Phase 1 (Procedural): Basic script using global variables.

    Phase 2 (Functional/Decoupled): Refactored to separate Business Logic from UI logic for better testability.

    Phase 3 (OOP - Current): Implementing Inheritance and Classes to handle data models and record management.

🛠️ Tech Stack

    Language: Python 3.x

    Concepts: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), File I/O, Error Handling.

    Tools: Git/GitHub for version control and issue tracking.

⚙️ Installation & Usage

Bash

    python main.py

🗺️ Roadmap (Next Steps)

    [ ] Database Integration: Migrate from local file storage/lists to PostgreSQL.

    [ ] Unit Testing: Implement unittest or pytest to ensure business logic reliability.

    [ ] API Layer: Wrap the logic in a Flask/FastAPI REST API.
